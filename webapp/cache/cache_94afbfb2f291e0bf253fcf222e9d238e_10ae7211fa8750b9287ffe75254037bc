				<p>If you&#39;ve read anything at all about Content Management Systems (CMS), you&#39;ll probably know at least three things: CMS are the most exciting way to do business, CMS can be really, I mean <em>really</em>, complicated and lastly Portals are absolutely, outrageously, often <em>unaffordably</em> expensive. <br /><br /><div class="mosimage"  style=" border-width: 1px; float: left; width: 120px;" align="center"><img src="http://development.mwds.ca/erp//images/stories/asterisk.png" width="70" height="67" hspace="6" alt="Joomla!

Mahsie CMS is different from the normal models for portal software. For a start, it&#39;s not complicated. It is based on the Joomla! CMS and has been developed for the masses. It&#39;s licensed under the GNU/GPL license, easy to install and administer and reliable. It doesn&#39;t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it&#39;s up and running.</p><p>&nbsp;This demo is designed to highlight its features and how it integrates with Mahsie&#39;s ERP and CRM solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please use the menu at the left to select where you would like to go!</p>			</td>
