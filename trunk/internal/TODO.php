<b>** Joomla! 1.5.0 Beta Release [???] **</b>

<span class="highlight">** This should NOT meant to be used for a `live` or `production` site **</span>
This Beta version is for testing and development purposes, or internal use only.  Use at your own risk!

<span class="todotitle">BROKEN</span>

To be able to handle all languages correctly we are moving towards UTF-8. It's clear that
this transistion will go with a few roadbumps. We predict problems with upgrading from an
existing db, and the use of some string related PHP functions. We are aware of these issues.

The reason for the alpha is to get them identified. U can help us by clearly stating problems
u are experiencing. For now we advice u to stay away from upgrading an existing site.
Upgrading problems will be handled after we identified and fixed any problems with translations
and new installs.
